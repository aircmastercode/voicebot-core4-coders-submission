# Peer- 2 - Peer lending in India

##### Applied, January 2022


### India’s P2P lending market overview

```
● Peer to Peer (P2P) lending service providers have been in business in India since early 2014,
but until 2017, there was no regulation around it.
● In September 2017, RBI notified that these will be registered as non-banking financial
companies (NBFCs) and came out with guidelines
● P2P lending platforms now have to hold licenses as Non-Banking Financial Companies
(NBFC-P2P as per RBI directive 2017)
● As per the economic survey, traditional banks disbursed only 5% of the loans to MSEs. The
shortage of funds can be filled by the P2P lending industry leading to the popularity of this sector
among the small scale enterprises.
● According to a report by PwC, India’s P2P lending is expected to be USD 4 billion in next five
years (2026) which is very low as compared to China’s current P2P lending which is USD 100
billion.

illegal businesses.

### Future scope of P2P

```
Above mentioned RBI regulations are expected to impact the P2P lending space as follows:
● The market for peer-to-peer lending in India is expected to reach $10.5 billion by 2026 ,
rising at a CAGR of 21.6% in the forecast period of 2021-2026. (IndustryARC)
● A major chunk of the currently underserved market will be covered under the financial
umbrella.
● People that are currently opting for banks to fulfil their financial needs, would migrate to P2P
lending platforms as the P2P loan application processes are very efficient. (like in US &
UK)
● For the lenders on these P2P platforms, the returns are very lucrative which will continue to
be the case along with more checks and processes introduced by P2P platforms in order
to keep NPAs in check.

# Conclusions


## Indian landscape

```
Based on a high level study of 20-odd licensed P2P platforms in India, we note -
● The average loan tenure is between 3 - 36 months.
● Some of the lowest interest rates paid by borrower is offered by Rang de at 0 - 8%pa that targets rural
entrepreneurs to provide loans. The highest interest rate given to lender is offered by PeerLendand OxyLoansat
14 - 36%pa , that caters to both self employed and salaried individuals to provide loans.
● The platform revenue is commission-based or membership-based, and depends on the percentage or fixed
amount levied as registration/listing fees, processing fees and repayment collected (EMI).
● As part of credit assessment each P2P platform have their own proprietary credit algorithms which also looks into
CIBIL score, repayment history, cash flow, document verification, ITR filing, physical verification, ability to pay and
intent to pay.
● At the time of non-payment, the borrower is entitled to pay back the loan amount and the p2p platform is not the
sole responsible entity for non-repayment. The platform will provide assistance through providing legal service
or aid from third party.
```

## P2P lending an alternative asset

```
● Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending gives investors a chance to earn competitive annual returns
by investing in unsecured personal loans to other consumers through various p2p
platforms.
```
```
● P2P lending can be considered as part of an allocation to high risk/high return alternative
investments, which can provide diversification benefits.
```
```
● Investing through a P2P platform can work well if risks are managed -
○ Investments are not liquid (one must wait for the borrower to repay the loan before the entire
principal amount is returned).
○ A future economic recession could lead to widespread loan defaults leading to diminished returns
and/or a loss of principal.
```

## Picking P2P platforms for investment

```
Investors may want to -
● Favour loans to borrowers with history of timely repayment
● Look into the non-performing asset ratio of platforms (if available)
● Favour loans where the borrower has greater employment stability
● Review and opt for platforms that offer upstanding investor protection from borrowers
(e.g. platforms asking for post dated cheques, insurance & loan buybacks from
borrowers)
● Diversified across several platforms and loans
