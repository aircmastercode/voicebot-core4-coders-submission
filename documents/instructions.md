## FAQs

**Why should I lend with P2P lending platform?**
P2P Lending is a non-market linked instrument. It allows you to diversify your portfolio to reduce
risk, and earn potentially high returns.


**Is my money safe?**
Credit Default Risk: Despite rigorous underwriting and verification, lending carries inherent risks,
mitigated by LenDenClub’s capital matching algorithm for diversification.
Collection Risk: In case of default, LenDenClub follows RBI-compliant recovery measures,
minimizing impact through diversified lending.
**What is the platform NPA?**
The latest platform NPA as on December 2024 is 3.78% across all loan options.
**How much can I earn?**
It is important to know that P2P Lending does not guarantee any returns. Historically 72% users
on manual lending have earned more than 20% p.a. Returns may vary from portfolio to portfolio.
We suggest our customers to diversify their lending portfolio to reduce risk as much as possible.
