We’re excited to share that we’ve hit major milestones! Thanks to innovation and

process improvements, the retail and CP segments are growing, with more customers

choosing our Short Term Lending Option. Lender participation through our app and

web has doubled, while Instamoney loan disbursements grew by 25%, bringing us

close to ₹700 crore in total. Our Instamoney app has also surpassed 3 crore

downloads, making us one of the top 5 loan platforms.

This progress is thanks to the trust of our lenders and our focus on smarter, faster

financial solutions.

There was a plan to increase lender's returns from 11% to 12% and beyond from start of this year. For the

same, an increase in borrower's interest rate and a change in product mix were done, as a result there is an

increase expected in NPA for a few months as that portfolio is now maturing. Last time we did similar change

almost a year ago to take lender's return to 11% from 10% with little increase in NPA and change in product

mix which was successfully achieved.
