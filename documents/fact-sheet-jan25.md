## Platform Performance Factsheet

## JANUARY 2025


```
In January 2025, our AI initiatives delivered significant results. LenDenGenie, our proprietary AI
chatbot, now handles 35% of customer queries with a 62% resolution rate, providing instant
responses and eliminating the previous 24-hour wait time. This has freed up over 70 agent hours
```
```
per month, allowing our team to focus on more complex issues. Initially deployed for loan
products, we plan to expand LenDenGenie's capabilities to our lender services.
We also achieved a record loan recollection rate of 96.13%, our highest performance to date.
Disbursement value reached 85% of our previous peak (July 2024), demonstrating a strong
recovery and indicating that the impact of regulatory changes is subsiding. This positive
```
```
momentum, coupled with a 40% month-over-month increase in users, underscores the growing
interest and potential of P2P lending in India. We believe this positions the platform for a
sustained growth phase.
