# Bhavin Patel

CEO, LenDenClub Platforms
Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

## Summary

```
True to my roots of being a quintessential Gujarati, I am positively
stereotypical in my entrepreneurial approach. I co-founded
LenDenClub in 2015 with a vision of having an enhanced investor
experience. Despite not being blessed with top B-school credentials
and experience from the big giants, I am a go-getter, bullish, very
desi, ROI minded and like to understand the consumers by the
pulse.
```
```
I brought P2P in India and I didn't believe in running after seed
funding - I first built the base and only then approached for seed
funding. There is no success with shortcuts and this belief of mine
makes me an advocate of hard work, discipline and integrity.
```
```
Discipline comes from my sports background and love for sports -
an avid football player and has in fact found my LenDenClub co-
founder through football itself - Dipesh, with whom I played and still
play football. This culture of football has thus been instilled amongst
every LenDenite through a positive reinforcement of participation
every Thursday post work. I religiously play football every Sunday
with my circle at 4 in the morning.
```
```
I am passionate about what I do, whether it's work, football, fitness
or love for mobiles & cars. Hierarchy is never a yardstick for me and
l prefer being emphatic and equal in my day-to-day interactions with
team members whether a GET/MT or my Co-Founder.
```
```
I've learnt from my experiences immensely, far more than what
books could've taught me. And it's only fair to pass on what you get.
My ambition is not just to be a successful entrepreneur but I yearn to
be a contributor to the nation by disrupting the FinTech space.
