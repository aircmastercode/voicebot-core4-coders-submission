Annex VI
Directions on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial
Services by NBFC-P2P
```
**1. Introduction**
1.1 'Outsourcing' is defined as the NBFC’s use of a third party (either an affiliated entity
within a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to perform
activities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the NBFC itself, now
or in the future.
‘Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period.
1.2 NBFCs have been outsourcing various activities and are hence exposed to various
risks as detailed in para 5.3. Further, the outsourced activities are to be brought within
regulatory purview to a) protect the interest of the customers of NBFCs and b) to ensure
that the NBFC concerned and the Reserve Bank of India have access to all relevant
books, records and information available with service provider. Typically outsourced
financial services include applications processing (loan origination, credit card), document
processing, marketing and research, supervision of loans, data processing and back office
related activities, besides others.
1.3 Some key risks in outsourcing are Strategic Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance
Risk, Operational Risk, Legal Risk, Exit Strategy Risk, Counterparty Risk, Country Risk,
Contractual Risk, Access Risk, Concentration and Systemic Risk. The failure of a service
provider in providing a specified service, a breach in security/ confidentiality, or non-
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements by the service provider can lead to
financial losses or loss of reputation for the NBFC and could also lead to systemic risks.
1.4 It is therefore imperative for the NBFC outsourcing its activities to ensure sound and
responsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and
management of risks arising from such outsourced activities. The directions are applicable
to material outsourcing arrangements as explained in para 3 which may be entered into by
an NBFC with a service provider located in India or elsewhere. The service provider may
either be a member of the group/ conglomerate to which the NBFC belongs, or an
unrelated party.
1.5 The underlying principles behind these directions are that the regulated entity shall
ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its obligations to
customers and RBI nor impede effective supervision by RBI. NBFCs, therefore, have to
take steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in
performing the services as is expected to be employed by the NBFCs, if the activities were
conducted within the NBFCs and not outsourced. Accordingly, NBFCs shall not engage in
outsourcing that would result in their internal control, business conduct or reputation being
compromised or weakened.


1.6 (i) These directions are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of financial
services and are not applicable to technology-related issues and activities not related
to financial services, such as usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and
janitorial services, security of the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc.
NBFCs which desire to outsource financial services would not require prior approval from
RBI. However, such arrangements would be subject to on-site/ off- site monitoring and
inspection/ scrutiny by RBI.
(ii) In regard to outsourced services relating to credit cards, RBI's detailed instructions
contained in its circular on credit card activities vide DBOD.FSD.BC.49/24.01.011/2005-06
dated November 21, 2005 would be applicable.

**2. Activities that shall not be outsourced**
NBFC-P2Ps which choose to outsource any of their functions shall, however, not
outsource core management functions including Internal Audit, Strategic and Compliance
functions, pricing of services/ fees to be charged to borrowers/ lenders and decision-
making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms**.** However, for NBFC-
P2Ps in a group/conglomerate, these functions may be outsourced within the group
subject to compliance with instructions in Para 6. Further, while internal audit function itself
is a management process, the internal auditors can be on contract.
**3. Material Outsourcing**
For the purpose of these directions, material outsourcing arrangements are those which, if
disrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, reputation,
profitability or customer service. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on:
    - the level of importance to the NBFC of the activity being outsourced as well as the
       significance of the risk posed by the same;
    - the potential impact of the outsourcing on the NBFC on various parameters such as
       earnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile;
    - the likely impact on the NBFC’s reputation and brand value, and ability to
       achieve its business objectives, strategy and plans, should the service provider fail
       to perform the service;
    - the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the NBFC;
    - the aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the
       NBFC outsources various functions to the same service provider and
    - the significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and
       protection.


**4. NBFC's role and Regulatory and Supervisory Requirements**
4.1 The outsourcing of any activity by NBFC does not diminish its obligations, and those
of its Board and senior management, who have the ultimate responsibility for the
outsourced activity. NBFCs would therefore be responsible for the actions of their service
provider including Direct Sales Agents/ Direct Marketing Agents and recovery agents and
the confidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that is available with the
service provider. NBFCs shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity.
4.2 It is imperative for the NBFC, when performing its due diligence in relation to
outsourcing, to consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of
approval, licensing or registration.
4.3 Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the rights of a customer against the NBFC,
including the ability of the customer to obtain redress as applicable under relevant laws. In
cases where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in the process of
dealing with the NBFC, NBFCs shall incorporate a clause in the relative product literature/
brochures, etc., stating that they may use the services of agents in sales/ marketing etc. of
the products. The role of agents may be indicated in broad terms.
4.4 The service provider shall not impede or interfere with the ability of the NBFC to
effectively oversee and manage its activities nor shall it impede the Reserve Bank of India
in carrying out its supervisory functions and objectives.
4.5 NBFCs need to have a robust grievance redress mechanism, which in no way shall
be compromised on account of outsourcing.
4.6 The service provider, if not a group company of the NBFC, shall not be owned or
controlled by any director of the NBFC or their relatives; these terms have the same
meaning as assigned under Companies Act, 2013.
**5. Risk Management practices for Outsourced Financial Services
5.1 Outsourcing Policy**
An NBFC intending to outsource any of its financial activities shall put in place a
comprehensive outsourcing policy, approved by its Board, which incorporates, inter alia,
criteria for selection of such activities as well as service providers, delegation of authority
depending on risks and materiality and systems to monitor and review the operations of
these activities.
**5.2 Role of the Board and Senior Management
5.2.1 Role of the Board**
The Board of the NBFC, or a Committee of the Board to which powers have been
delegated shall be responsible _inter alia_ for the following:
    i. approving a framework to evaluate the risks and materiality of all existing and
    prospective outsourcing and the policies that apply to such arrangements;


```
ii. laying down appropriate approval authorities for outsourcing depending on risks
and materiality;
iii. setting up suitable administrative framework of senior management for the purpose
of these directions;
iv. undertaking regular review of outsourcing strategies and arrangements for their
continued relevance, and safety and soundness and
v. deciding on business activities of a material nature to be outsourced, and approving
such arrangements.
```
**5.2.2 Responsibilities of the Senior Management**
i. Evaluating the risks and materiality of all existing and prospective outsourcing,
based on the framework approved by the Board;
ii. developing and implementing sound and prudent outsourcing policies and
procedures commensurate with the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing
activity;
iii. reviewing periodically the effectiveness of policies and procedures;
iv. communicating information pertaining to material outsourcing risks to the Board in a
timely manner;
v. ensuring that contingency plans, based on realistic and probable disruptive
scenarios, are in place and tested;
vi. ensuring that there is independent review and audit for compliance with set policies
and
vii. undertaking periodic review of outsourcing arrangements to identify new material
outsourcing risks as they arise.

**5.3 Evaluation of the Risks**
The NBFCs shall evaluate and guard against the following risks in outsourcing:
i. Strategic Risk – Where the service provider conducts business on its own behalf,
inconsistent with the overall strategic goals of the NBFC.
ii. Reputation Risk – Where the service provided is poor and customer interaction is
not consistent with the overall standards expected of the NBFC.
iii. Compliance Risk – Where privacy, consumer and prudential laws are not
adequately complied with by the service provider.
iv. Operational Risk- Arising out of technology failure, fraud, error, inadequate
financial capacity to fulfil obligations and/ or to provide remedies.
v. Legal Risk – Where the NBFC is subjected to fines, penalties, or punitive
damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements due to
omissions and commissions of the service provider.


vi. Exit Strategy Risk – Where the NBFC is over-reliant on one firm, the loss of
relevant skills in the NBFC itself preventing it from bringing the activity back in-
house and where NBFC has entered into contracts that make speedy exits
prohibitively expensive.
vii. Counter party Risk – Where there is inappropriate underwriting or credit
assessments.
viii. Contractual Risk – Where the NBFC may not have the ability to enforce the
contract.
ix. Concentration and Systemic Risk – Where the overall industry has considerable
exposure to one service provider and hence the NBFC may lack control over the
service provider.
x. Country Risk – Due to the political, social or legal climate creating added risk.
**5.4 Evaluating the Capability of the Service Provider**
5.4.1 In considering or renewing an outsourcing arrangement, appropriate due diligence
shall be performed to assess the capability of the service provider to comply with
obligations in the outsourcing agreement. Due diligence shall take into consideration
qualitative and quantitative, financial, operational and reputational factors. NBFCs shall
consider whether the service providers' systems are compatible with their own and also
whether their standards of performance including in the area of customer service are
acceptable to it. NBFCs shall also consider, while evaluating the capability of the service
provider, issues relating to undue concentration of outsourcing arrangements with a single
service provider. Where possible, the NBFC shall obtain independent reviews and market
feedback on the service provider to supplement its own findings.
5.4.2 Due diligence shall involve an evaluation of all available information about the
service provider, including but not limited to the following:
i. past experience and competence to implement and support the proposed activity over
the contracted period;
ii. financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse
conditions;
iii. business reputation and culture, compliance, complaints and outstanding or potential
litigation;
iv. security and internal control, audit coverage, reporting and monitoring environment,
business continuity management and
v. ensuring due diligence by service provider of its employees.
**5.5 The Outsourcing Agreement**
The terms and conditions governing the contract between the NBFC and the service
provider shall be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by NBFC's legal
counsel on their legal effect and enforceability. Every such agreement shall address the


risks and risk mitigation strategies. The agreement shall be sufficiently flexible to allow the
NBFC to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourcing and the right to
intervene with appropriate measures to meet legal and regulatory obligations. The
agreement shall also bring out the nature of legal relationship between the parties, i.e.,
whether agent, principal or otherwise. Some of the key provisions of the contract shall be
the following:
i. the contract shall clearly define what activities are going to be outsourced including
appropriate service and performance standards;
ii. the NBFC must ensure it has the ability to access all books, records and information
relevant to the outsourced activity available with the service provider;
iii. the contract shall provide for continuous monitoring and assessment by the NBFC of
the service provider so that any necessary corrective measure can be taken
immediately;
iv. a termination clause and minimum period to execute a termination provision, if
deemed necessary, shall be included;
v. controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service providers' liability in case
of breach of security and leakage of confidential customer related information shall be
incorporated;
vi. there must be contingency plans to ensure business continuity;
vii. the contract shall provide for the prior approval/ consent by the NBFC of the use of
subcontractors by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced activity;
viii. it shall provide the NBFC with the right to conduct audits on the service provider
whether by its internal or external auditors, or by agents appointed to act on its behalf
and to obtain copies of any audit or review reports and findings made on the service
provider in conjunction with the services performed for the NBFC;
ix. outsourcing agreements shall include clauses to allow the Reserve Bank of India or
persons authorised by it to access the NBFC's documents, records of transactions,
and other necessary information given to, stored or processed by the service provider
within a reasonable time;
x. outsourcing agreement shall also include a clause to recognise the right of the
Reserve Bank to cause an inspection to be made of a service provider of an NBFC
and its books and account by one or more of its officers or employees or other
persons;
xi. the outsourcing agreement shall also provide that confidentiality of customer's
information shall be maintained even after the contract expires or gets terminated and
xii. the NBFC shall have necessary provisions to ensure that the service provider
preserves documents as required by law and take suitable steps to ensure that its
interests are protected in this regard even post termination of the services.


**5.6 Confidentiality and Security**
5.6.1 Public confidence and customer trust in the NBFC is a prerequisite for the stability
and reputation of the NBFC. Hence the NBFC shall seek to ensure the preservation and
protection of the security and confidentiality of customer information in the custody or
possession of the service provider.
5.6.2 Access to customer information by staff of the service provider shall be on 'need to
know' basis i.e., limited to those areas where the information is required in order to perform
the outsourced function.
5.6.3 The NBFC shall ensure that the service provider is able to isolate and clearly
identify the NBFC's customer information, documents, records and assets to protect the
confidentiality of the information. In instances, where service provider acts as an
outsourcing agent for multiple NBFCs, care shall be taken to build strong safeguards so
that there is no comingling of information / documents, records and assets.
5.6.4 The NBFC shall review and monitor the security practices and control processes of
the service provider on a regular basis and require the service provider to disclose security
breaches.
5.6.5 The NBFC shall immediately notify RBI in the event of any breach of security and
leakage of confidential customer related information. In these eventualities, the NBFC
would be liable to its customers for any damages.

**5.7 Responsibilities of Direct Sales Agents (DSA)/ Direct Marketing Agents (DMA)/
Recovery Agents**
5.7.1 NBFCs shall ensure that the DSA/ DMA/ Recovery Agents are properly trained to
handle their responsibilities with care and sensitivity, particularly aspects such as soliciting
customers, hours of calling, privacy of customer information and conveying the correct
terms and conditions of the products on offer, etc.
5.7.2 NBFCs shall put in place a board approved Code of conduct for DSA/ DMA/
Recovery Agents, and obtain their undertaking to abide by the code. In addition, Recovery
Agents shall adhere to extant instructions on Fair Practices Code for NBFCs as also their
own code for collection of dues and repossession of security. It is essential that the
Recovery Agents refrain from action that could damage the integrity and reputation of the
NBFC and that they observe strict customer confidentiality.
5.7.3 The NBFC and their agents shall not resort to intimidation or harassment of any
kind, either verbal or physical, against any person in their debt collection efforts, including
acts intended to humiliate publicly or intrude upon the privacy of the debtors' family
members, referees and friends, sending inappropriate messages either on mobile or


```
through social media, making threatening and/or anonymous calls, persistently^10 calling the
borrower and/ or calling the borrower before 8:00 a.m. and after 7:00 p.m. for recovery of
overdue loans, making false and misleading representations, etc. Any violation in this
regard will be viewed seriously^11.
```
```
5.8 Business Continuity and Management of Disaster Recovery Plan
5.8.1 An NBFC shall require its service providers to develop and establish a robust
framework for documenting, maintaining and testing business continuity and recovery
procedures. NBFCs need to ensure that the service provider periodically tests the
Business Continuity and Recovery Plan and may also consider occasional joint testing and
recovery exercises with its service provider.
5.8.2 In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing agreement
or liquidation of the service provider, NBFCs shall retain an appropriate level of control
over their outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to continue its
business operations in such cases without incurring prohibitive expenses and without any
break in the operations of the NBFC and its services to the customers.
5.8.3 In establishing a viable contingency plan, NBFCs shall consider the availability of
alternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced activity back in-
house in an emergency and the costs, time and resources that would be involved.
5.8.4 Outsourcing often leads to the sharing of facilities operated by the service provider.
The NBFC shall ensure that service providers are able to isolate the NBFC's information,
documents and records, and other assets. This is to ensure that in appropriate situations,
all documents, records of transactions and information given to the service provider, and
assets of the NBFC, can be removed from the possession of the service provider in order
to continue its business operations, or deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable.
```
```
5.9 Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities
5.9.1 The NBFC shall have in place a management structure to monitor and control its
outsourcing activities. It shall ensure that outsourcing agreements with the service provider
contain provisions to address their monitoring and control of outsourced activities.
5.9.2 A central record of all material outsourcing that is readily accessible for review by
the Board and senior management of the NBFC shall be maintained. The records shall be
updated promptly and half yearly reviews shall be placed before the Board or Risk
Management Committee.
5.9.3 Regular audits by either the internal auditors or external auditors of the NBFC shall
assess the adequacy of the risk management practices adopted in overseeing and

managing the outsourcing arrangement, the NBFC's compliance with its risk management
framework and the requirements of these directions.

5.9.4 NBFCs shall at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operational
condition of the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing
obligations. Such due diligence reviews, which can be based on all available information
about the service provider shall highlight any deterioration or breach in performance
standards, confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.
5.9.5 In the event of termination of the outsourcing agreement for any reason in cases
where the service provider deals with the customers, the same shall be publicized by
displaying at a prominent place in the branch, posting it on the web-site, and informing the
customers so as to ensure that the customers do not continue to deal with the service
provider.
5.9.6 Certain cases, like outsourcing of cash management, might involve reconciliation of
transactions between the NBFC, the service provider and its sub-contractors. In such
cases, NBFCs shall ensure that reconciliation of transactions between the NBFC and the
service provider (and/ or its sub-contractor), are carried out in a timely manner. An ageing
analysis of entries pending reconciliation with outsourced vendors shall be placed before
the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) and NBFCs shall make efforts to reduce the old
outstanding items therein at the earliest.
5.9.7 A robust system of internal audit of all outsourced activities shall also be put in place
and monitored by the ACB of the NBFC.

**5.10 Redress of Grievances related to Outsourced Services**
i. NBFCs shall constitute Grievance Redressal Machinery as contained in RBI’s
circular on Grievance Redressal Mechanism vide DNBS.CC.PD.No.320/03.10.01/2012-
13 dated February 18, 2013. At the operational level, all NBFCs shall display the name
and contact details (Telephone/ Mobile nos. as also email address) of the Grievance
Redressal Officer prominently at their branches/ places where business is transacted.
The designated officer shall ensure that genuine grievances of customers are redressed
promptly without involving delay. It shall be clearly indicated that NBFCs' Grievance
Redressal Machinery will also deal with the issue relating to services provided by the
outsourced agency.
ii. Generally, a time limit of 30 days may be given to the customers for preferring their
complaints/ grievances. The grievance redressal procedure of the NBFC and the time
frame fixed for responding to the complaints shall be placed on the NBFC's website.


**5.11 Reporting of transactions to FIU or other competent authorities**
NBFCs would be responsible for making Currency Transactions Reports and Suspicious
Transactions Reports to FIU or any other competent authority in respect of the NBFCs'
customer related activities carried out by the service providers.

**6. Outsourcing within a Group/ Conglomerate**
6.1 In a group structure, NBFCs may have back-office and service arrangements/

# agreements with group entities e.g., sharing of premises, legal and other professional

services, hardware and software applications, centralize back-office functions, outsourcing
certain financial services to other group entities, etc. Before entering into such
arrangements with group entities, NBFCs shall have a Board approved policy and also
service level agreements/arrangements with their group entities, which shall also cover

# demarcation of sharing resources i.e., premises, personnel, etc. Moreover the customers

shall be informed specifically about the company which is actually offering the
product/service, wherever there are multiple group entities involved or any cross selling
observed.
6.2 While entering into such arrangements, NBFCs shall ensure that these:
a. are appropriately documented in written agreements with details like scope of services,
charges for the services and maintaining confidentiality of the customer's data;
b. do not lead to any confusion to the customers on whose products/services they are
availing by clear physical demarcation of the space where the activities of the NBFC and
those of its other group entities are undertaken;
c. do not compromise the ability to identify and manage risk of the NBFC on a stand-
alone basis;
d. do not prevent the RBI from being able to obtain information required for the
supervision of the NBFC or pertaining to the group as a whole; and
e. incorporate a clause under the written agreements that there is a clear obligation for
any service provider to comply with directions given by the RBI in relation to the activities
of the NBFC.
6.3 NBFCs shall ensure that their ability to carry out their operations in a sound fashion
would not be affected if premises or other services (such as IT systems, support staff)
provided by the group entities become unavailable.
6.4 If the premises of the NBFC are shared with the group entities for the purpose of
cross-selling, NBFCs shall take measures to ensure that the entity's identification is
distinctly visible and clear to the customers. The marketing brochure used by the group
entity and verbal communication by its staff / agent in the NBFCs premises shall mention
nature of arrangement of the entity with the NBFC so that the customers are clear on the
seller of the product.


6.5 NBFCs shall not publish any advertisement or enter into any agreement stating or
suggesting or giving tacit impression that they are in any way responsible for the
obligations of its group entities.
6.6 The risk management practices expected to be adopted by an NBFC while
outsourcing to a related party (i.e. party within the Group / Conglomerate) would be
identical to those specified in Para 5 of this directions.

**7. Off-shore outsourcing of Financial Services**
7.1 The engagement of service providers in a foreign country exposes an NBFC to
country risk -economic, social and political conditions and events in a foreign country that
may adversely affect the NBFC. Such conditions and events could prevent the service
provider from carrying out the terms of its agreement with the NBFC. To manage the
country risk involved in such outsourcing activities, the NBFC shall take into account
and closely monitor government policies and political, social, economic and legal
conditions in countries where the service provider is based, both during the risk
assessment process and on a continuous basis, and establish sound procedures for
dealing with country risk problems. This includes having appropriate contingency and
exit strategies. In principle, arrangements shall only be entered into with parties operating
in jurisdictions generally upholding confidentiality clauses and agreements. The governing
law of the arrangement shall also be clearly specified.
7.2 The activities outsourced outside India shall be conducted in a manner so as not to
hinder efforts to supervise or reconstruct the India activities of the NBFC in a timely
manner.
7.3 As regards the off-shore outsourcing of financial services relating to Indian
Operations, NBFCs shall additionally ensure that
    a) Where the off-shore service provider is a regulated entity, the relevant off-shore
    regulator will neither obstruct the arrangement nor object to RBI inspection visits/ visits of
    NBFCs internal and external auditors.
    b) The availability of records to management and the RBI will withstand the liquidation of
    either the offshore custodian or the NBFC in India.
    c) The regulatory authority of the offshore location does not have access to the data
    relating to Indian operations of the NBFC simply on the ground that the processing is
    being undertaken there (not applicable if off shore processing is done in the home
    country of the NBFC).
    d) The jurisdiction of the courts in the off shore location where data is maintained does
    not extend to the operations of the NBFC in India on the strength of the fact that the data
    is being processed there even though the actual transactions are undertaken in India and
e) All original records continue to be maintained in India.
