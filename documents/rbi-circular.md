### RBI Vision - Then (2016-2017) : Bullish

**April 2016 –RBI’s Consultation Paperon P2P Lending**

Its is good for all Stake Holders, though at nascent stage

Globally growing very fast ( 2200 times in 3 Years– 2012 - 2015 )

**What was the need arose ofP2P Lending in India after 70 Yrs of Independence:**

Digital Era shall start bringing money of **‘Micro Businesses’** in banking channel

They don’t get loan from Banks & NBFCs

They take Loan from Money Lenders at very high rate

P2P Platforms may help them to get loans at cheaper rate

Growth of these crores of **‘Micro Businesses’** shall help ingrowth of the economy

For **Lenders** opportunity to get higher interest than traditional products

RBI Launched-

P2P LendingIndustry

LicensesP2P-NBFC

# RBI Vision - Now (16 August 2024) : Bullish

**RBI’s 15 months HARDWORK to safeguard Lenders & Borrowers interest (June 2023 - Aug 2024 )**

RBI Started visiting all Platforms from June 2023 starting from Mumbai

Found many interpretation gaps in understanding Master Guidelines of 2017

RBI Guided platforms on few practices –Good , Improve and Stop

Money lying in Escrow account of Lenders

Secondary Sales( short term products , Long term loans)

Credit Enhancement Practices(e.g.120, 115, 108)

Though license given as platform but working as banks( Liquid Plans)

Major Concerns of RBI during such visits to Platforms:

RBI counselled platforms

```
RBI showed concerns on
public platforms & Media
```
RBI warned Platforms

RBI sent emails & letters

**Platforms actions:**

**Few kept on implementing(LDC)**

Few partially implemented

Few did not bother


## Actions taken by LenDenClub

Changed Lending journey by showing importanceto our esteemed Channel Partners

Did not bother to took hit on AUM (AUM dropped from Rs 2000 Cr to 800 Cr and then started growing

Did not bother to lose the income from such partnerships businesses

Did not bother “What people shall think”, rather we were vocal about AUM drop

A lot improvements in Lenders/ Borrowers KYC journey

A lot disclosures & transparencies introduced at various stages for Lenders

Reduced BNPL portfolio from 80% to Zero with in a period of 6 months& took hit on earnings

**People Treated Us**

## Ultimately what does RBI want?

**Platform should not have control on Lenders funds rather Lenders should have complete control**

**Let the Lendershave complete transparency of funds**

**Platform should not eatoutprofits of Lenders & at the same time should not indulge in credit enhancement**

**Platforms should not work as pseudo banks, let them work as exchange that was the original thought of RBI**

**Platforms should not indulge in ‘Secondary Sales’as this is notgood for Lenders**

##### Ultimately RBI wants to protect the

##### interest of Lenders as well as Borrowers


## Auto Lending

With auto lending, a Lender can automate the Lending process.

EMIs received from borrowers are directly deposited into Lenders bank account & by using the auto-debit,

the same amount is digitally debited from same account to re-lend in new loans as per set criterion

Lender has to set up the criteria, based on own preferences and sign an auto debit mandate.

##### Tenure – 12 & 18 Months

##### Past Performance – 11.23 %* XIRR

* Last 6 months average returns on 12 month lending tenure


## Past Interest Rate Earned by Lenders

0.19%

1.15%


## Old & New Process Flow at CP Dashboard

##### The Process flow and all screens at old & new

##### CP dashboard are same except following:

Some Text changes on some screensas per RBI guidelines

On Last screen pressing a button which sendsa link to Lender for e-NACH creation


## Myths about daily transactions

Before having this thought Pls check your bank statement :

On an average 250 to 300 transactions happen in normal bank account. Before launch we checked around 2 lac diversified strataaccounts

Because of UPI, transactions in Bank account has become normal. In India 450 Crstransactions happen per month through UPI

Any urban consumer caried 2 to 3 bank accounts:If you wish you can use any dormant account for this purpose

Your Hard earned money:30 to 40 transactions in a month give you control on your hard earned money and flexibility

You shall get proper statement:With Credit and Debit transactions which shall exactly match with your bank statement

Not a Black box now :You can track daily, how your funds are growing

##### If RBI is working in the Lenders interest,

##### lets respect RBI’s thought process
