# AI-Humanized P2P Lending Voicebot Hackathon

## Project Overview
We are building a state-of-the-art P2P Lending Awareness & Sales voice bot application for the AI-Humanized Voicebot Hackathon. The voice bot will educate potential users about Peer-to-Peer lending and guide them through the initial sales and onboarding process, replicating the fluency, adaptability, and empathy of a human sales representative.

## Key Requirements
1. The voice bot must process voice input from users and provide text/voice output
2. The system must accurately answer questions about P2P lending based on provided documents
3. The bot must maintain context throughout conversations
4. All advanced features listed in the "Gaining the Edge" section are mandatory

## Technical Components
1. **ASR Module**: Automatic Speech Recognition with multilingual support and noise cancellation
2. **NLP Pipeline**: Intent recognition, entity extraction, and context management
3. **Response Generation**: Knowledge-based responses with human-like conversational flow
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Hyper-realistic voice output with emotional resonance
5. **Performance Optimization**: Near-zero latency interaction
6. **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Serverless architecture for NLP processing

## AWS Bedrock Lambda Integration
1. **Lambda Function**: Middleware to interact with AWS Bedrock services
   - Environment variables for Bedrock resource IDs
   - Handlers for multiple operations (intent recognition, entity extraction, etc.)
   - JSON parsing and response formatting
   
2. **API Gateway**: REST API endpoint for Lambda function
   - Single /nlp resource with POST method
   - Proper mapping templates for request/response handling
   - Optional API key security
   
3. **Bedrock Services**:
   - Agent Runtime for intent recognition and entity extraction
   - Knowledge Base for querying P2P lending documents
   - Foundation Models (Claude 3) for response generation
   
4. **Python Client**: API client for communicating with Lambda via API Gateway
   - Environment variables for API Gateway URL and API key
   - Methods for all NLP operations

## Advanced Features (All Mandatory)
1. **Hyper-Realistic Voice Synthesis**: Emotionally resonant output with natural pacing
2. **Near-Zero Latency Interaction**: Real-time conversational experience
3. **Seamless Multilingual Dexterity**: Support for English, Hindi, and Hinglish with interruption handling
4. **Advanced Acoustic Clarity Engine**: Background noise cancellation and dereverberation
5. **Conversational Nuance Simulation**: Human-like discourse markers and pauses
6. **Strategic Prompt Architecture**: Sophisticated prompt engineering for optimal responses
7. **Optimized LLM Resource Management**: Efficient token usage and caching
8. **Deep Contextual Memory**: Long-term conversation recall
9. **Proactive Conversational Guidance**: Suggesting next steps and additional information
10. **Elegant Error & Ambiguity Resolution**: Graceful fallbacks and clarification questions

## Deliverables
1. **main.py**: Entry point for the live demo application
2. **run_inference.py**: Script for Round 1 evaluation (processes test.csv)
3. **requirements.txt**: List of all dependencies
4. **config/config.yaml**: Configuration for API keys and parameters
5. **modules/**: Directory containing all modular code components
   - **api_client.py**: Client for AWS API Gateway
   - **lambda_function.py**: AWS Lambda function code
   - **nlp_pipeline.py**: NLP processing pipeline
6. **README.md**: Setup and run instructions

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy, Factuality & Relevance**: Correctness and contextual appropriateness
2. **Human-like Interaction & Conversational Fluency**: Natural and engaging conversation
3. **Voice Input Understanding & Processing**: Handling different voices and ambiguity
4. **System Performance & Latency**: Speed and responsiveness
5. **Innovation, Robustness & Ethical AI**: Unique features and error handling

## Timeline
1. **Round 1 Submission Deadline**: 1:00 PM, Sunday, June 15th
2. **Round 2 Evaluation**: 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, Sunday, June 15th
