# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Seamless Multilingual Dexterity Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a module to handle seamless transitions between English, Hindi, and Hinglish with interruption handling.
# Details:
1. Implement a language identification module using the langdetect library (latest version)
2. Develop a custom tokenizer for Hinglish text
3. Implement language-specific processing pipelines
4. Create a smooth transition mechanism between languages
5. Integrate interruption handling with the ASR module
6. Implement context preservation across language switches
7. Optimize for low latency language switching
8. Ensure consistent entity recognition across languages

# Test Strategy:
Create test conversations with language switching, test interruption handling, evaluate language detection accuracy, and measure the seamlessness of transitions in both text and voice outputs.
