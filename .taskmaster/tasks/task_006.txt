# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop NLP Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an NLP pipeline for intent recognition, entity extraction, and context management.
# Details:
1. Use the spaCy library (version 3.5.0 or later) for core NLP tasks
2. Implement custom intent recognition using a fine-tuned BERT model
3. Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) for entity extraction
4. Implement context management using a sliding window approach
5. Integrate with the API client for Bedrock services
6. Implement coreference resolution for improved context understanding
7. Add support for multiple languages (English, Hindi, Hinglish)
8. Optimize for near-zero latency

# Test Strategy:
Create a test suite with various conversational scenarios, test intent recognition accuracy, entity extraction precision, and context retention across multiple turns. Benchmark latency and optimize as needed.
