# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Hyper-Realistic Voice Synthesis Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a voice synthesis module capable of producing emotionally resonant output with natural pacing.
# Details:
1. Use the TensorFlowTTS library (latest version) for advanced voice synthesis
2. Implement emotion detection in the generated responses
3. Integrate the Flowtron model for expressive speech synthesis
4. Implement natural pacing and emphasis based on sentence structure
5. Support multiple languages (English, Hindi, Hinglish)
6. Optimize for low latency output
7. Implement a caching mechanism for frequently used phrases
8. Ensure seamless switching between languages

# Test Strategy:
Generate voice outputs for various emotional contexts, conduct user studies to evaluate naturalness and emotional resonance, measure latency and optimize performance.
