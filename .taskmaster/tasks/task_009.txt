# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Advanced Acoustic Clarity Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a module for background noise cancellation and dereverberation in voice input.
# Details:
1. Use the pyroomacoustics library (latest version) for acoustic processing
2. Implement adaptive noise cancellation algorithms
3. Develop a dereverberation module using spectral subtraction techniques
4. Integrate with the ASR module for seamless processing
5. Implement real-time processing for low latency
6. Add support for various noise types (ambient, impulsive, etc.)
7. Optimize CPU/GPU usage for efficient processing
8. Implement a bypass option for high-quality audio inputs

# Test Strategy:
Test with various noisy audio samples, measure Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement, evaluate dereverberation effectiveness, and assess impact on ASR accuracy.
