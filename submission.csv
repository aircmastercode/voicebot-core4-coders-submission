"What is LenDenClub?","LenDenClub is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform owned and operated by Innofin Solutions Pvt Ltd, which is an RBI registered NBFC-P2P.

The key things to know about LenDenClub are:

1. It connects individual lenders directly with individual borrowers, cutting out traditional financial institutions as the middleman.

2. It operates using a transparent escrow mechanism to ensure the security of funds for both lenders and borrowers. There are separate bank accounts for lender and borrower funds, and all funds are returned to the respective parties within T+1 days.

3. Lenders can lend as little as ₹10,000 and diversify their lending across multiple borrowers. The platform caters to a range of borrowers, from those needing small loans under ₹10,000 to larger loans over ₹1 lakh.

4. The user base spans different age groups, with 53% being in the 35-44 age range, and different regions across India, with the highest concentration in the South.
